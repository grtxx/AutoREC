# AutoREC
AutoREC is a simple 24/7 segmented mp3 recording program with multiple sound card support.
It was used in some hungarian radios.

The program was written in Borland C++. You will need the Directsound SDK and maybe the Borland C++ compatible obj files. 
Some files were pointed to a wrong location in the project file but I believe that all the files is present in the repository.
